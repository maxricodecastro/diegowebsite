Homework Website Project Requirements Document
1. Overview
Project Title: Chat with Thinkers
Platform: Web (React)
Development Tool: Cursor AI coding tool
Objective:
Create a multi-page React website that simulates a chat interface with historical thinkers. Users will navigate via a landing page composed of image-buttons that lead to dedicated pages for each thinker (and lecture notes). Each page will feature an image and a simulated "chat" conversation that displays text in sequential chunks (to mimic an LLM backend).

2. Scope
The website will consist of five main pages:

Lecture Notes
Descartes
Searle
Turing
Dennett
Landing Page (Home)
Purpose:
The landing page serves as the entry point, displaying five images as clickable buttons. Each button corresponds to one of the main pages.
Features:
Five images (or icons), each representing one of the pages.
Clear visual indication that these are navigational buttons.
Individual Pages (Lecture Notes, Descartes, Searle, Turing, Dennett)
Structure:
Navigation Bar (Top):
Contains links to all pages (including a “Home” link to return to the landing page).
Chat Interface:
A chat-style text area that simulates a conversation.
The text is “generated” in chunks over time (to mimic an asynchronous LLM response), though no actual backend LLM integration is required.
Image (Bottom Left):
Each page will include a static image positioned in the bottom left corner.
The image can be a portrait, symbolic representation, or any graphic that relates to the thinker or content of the page.
3. Functional Requirements
Navigation
Navigation Bar:
Present on every page.
Includes links: Home, Lecture Notes, Descartes, Searle, Turing, Dennett.
Landing Page Buttons:
Each image-button on the landing page navigates to the corresponding page.
Chat Interface
Simulated Chat Output:
On each dedicated page, a chat interface will “simulate” receiving responses.
Text is revealed in chunks (simulated asynchronous behavior).
Should provide the illusion of a real-time conversation with the thinker.
User Interaction:
(Optional for future iterations) The user may be allowed to type a message which then triggers the “response” sequence.
For the homework project, this functionality can be simulated or static.
Content Display
Image Display:
A fixed image in the bottom left corner on each page.
The image can be thematically linked to the page content.
Text Styling:
Use a chat bubble style for displaying generated text.
Ensure readability and a user-friendly layout.
4. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance
Loading Time:
Pages should load quickly, and the simulated chat text should render smoothly.
Responsiveness:
The design should be responsive, adjusting to various screen sizes and devices.
Usability
User Experience:
Clear navigation structure with an intuitive UI.
The simulated chat should mimic real chat dynamics to engage the user.
Design & Aesthetics
Consistency:
Maintain a consistent color scheme and typography across all pages.
Accessibility:
Ensure that text contrasts and UI elements meet basic accessibility standards.
Technical
Technology Stack:
Frontend: React.js
Styling: CSS (or styled-components/SASS if preferred)
Routing: React Router (or similar) for page navigation
Simulated Async Behavior:
Use JavaScript (e.g., setTimeout) to simulate chunked text generation.
Image Assets:
Optimize images for web performance.
5. Design Considerations
UI Layout
Header:
Fixed navigation bar at the top for seamless page switching.
Main Content Area:
The primary area where the chat interface is displayed.
Footer/Image Area:
The static image placed at the bottom left of the page.
Interaction Flow
Landing Page:
User lands on the homepage.
User clicks one of the five image-buttons.
Individual Page:
Page loads with the navigation bar at the top.
Chat interface begins “generating” text in chunks.
Image is visible in the bottom left.
Navigation:
User can switch pages using the navigation bar at any time.
